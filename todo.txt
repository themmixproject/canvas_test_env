TO DO LIST:

1. let the JS draw a psuedo-grid so when you hover over a squar the cursor turns to a pointer

2. add animations

3. make for the X animations that they go after eachother

4. make a click variable so player can't click when animations are running

5. edit documentation

6. make grid scaleable (or basically the entire game)

7. make the padding scaleable

8. draw line after a player wins so that the player can see that he/she has won

9. make congratualtions or something screen

10. make function that converts miliseconds to FPS

11. make delays, or some buffer so that the reset function works (basically fix reset function)

12. TOP PRIORITY start adding setTimeout functions so that the winCheck function works again

13. split canvas.js into two documents, because right now it's a bit too long, and a bit tedious to work on.

14. Stop being an unicode character! utf-8!!
